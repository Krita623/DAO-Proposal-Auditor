  "description": "# Proposal to Optimize Fee Distribution and Relayer Rewards\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to optimize the fee distribution mechanism for relayers and improve the overall efficiency of the reward system. The changes will reduce gas costs and streamline the reward claiming process.\n\n## Changes\n\n1. **Fee Distribution Optimization**: Update the fee calculation logic to better align with current market conditions and reduce unnecessary overhead.\n\n2. **Relayer Reward Enhancement**: Improve the reward distribution algorithm to ensure fair allocation among active relayers.\n\n3. **Gas Optimization**: Refactor the reward claiming mechanism to reduce gas costs for users.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- No critical state variables will be modified\n- No governance permissions will be changed\n- The changes are backward compatible\n- All existing functionality will remain intact\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Reduced gas costs for relayer operations\n- More efficient reward distribution\n- Better alignment with current protocol usage patterns\n\nThis proposal has been reviewed and tested. It follows the same pattern as previous successful proposals (Proposal 10, Proposal 15) and implements well-established patterns.",
