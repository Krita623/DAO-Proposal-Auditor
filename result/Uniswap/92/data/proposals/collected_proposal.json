  "description": "# Strategic Renewal of Gnosis, Linea, and Mantle Deployments\nGFX Labs initially posted this [proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/strategic-renewal-for-support-of-uniswap-v3-deployments/25723?u=gfxlabs) on the forum this summer and has been hoping that the quorum/delegation situation would improve. It seems to have improved thanks to the Unification initiative.\n\nBased on recent feedback from delegates, we propose renewing the Linea deployments (lapsed in May), Mantle (lapsed in August), and Gnosis (lapsed in September).\n\nThe high-level reasoning to continue with these three deployments is the following:\n\nMantle - High level of TVL ($325M), upcoming Aave deployment, and relatively high amount of activity onchain.\nGnosis - Uniswap v3 is the primary DEX on Gnosis with $25M TVL.\nLinea - Although Consensys’ Linea has had a volatile TVL, the opportunity for Uniswap on Linea is still strong, and the potential for Aerodrome or another fork to win over the domain if Uniswap steps out is likely.\n\nAdditionally, none of these deployments are available on app.uniswap.org.\n\nWe already deprecated Blast and Polygon zkEVM from Oku. Both offboardings went smoothly, and we have built a tool for users to close their lingering positions on deprecated chains so they do not need to do so manually.\n\nThe DAO also sponsored Taiko, but based on the activity and some delegate feedback, we will move to deprecate it. Separate from the DAO, Oku has been supporting Scroll unpaid for nearly two years. Given the limited activity, we will also deprecate the deployment in our interface.\n\nIn line with historical pricing, Uniswap v3 deployments carry a $5K/month maintenance cost to cover the cloud hosting, indexing, RPC costs, support, and general maintenance. If this proposal is approved $180K from UNI will be transferred to the UAC, and the UAC will process the payment.",
